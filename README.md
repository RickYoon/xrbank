# xrBankDao : the central bank for xrp evm-sidechain

xrp evm-sidechain project  
(MakerDao Forked)

# Why xrbank?

XRPL’s DeFi ecosystem holds tremendous potential. In the Korean market alone, over 8 billion XRP are held on centralized exchanges (CEX), with more than 2 million holders. However, the DeFi market remains relatively undeveloped.

Moving forward, XRPL plans to launch its own stablecoin and an EVM sidechain. However, for the new chain to achieve stable and sustainable growth, a crypto-backed stablecoin is essential.

We are committed to filling this crucial gap by introducing a robust, crypto-backed stablecoin that will serve as the foundation for XRPL’s DeFi ecosystem. This stablecoin will not only enhance the security and stability of the network but also provide XRP holders with new opportunities to earn yield and participate in decentralized finance. Our vision is to unlock the full potential of XRPL’s DeFi capabilities, ensuring that it becomes a leading player in the global blockchain economy.
